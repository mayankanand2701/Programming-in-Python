# a
# = is the assignment operator, used to assign a value to a variable.
# For example: x = 5 assigns the value 5 to the variable x.
# == is the equality operator, used to compare two values for equality.
# For example: 5 == 5 evaluates to True because 5 is equal to 5.

# b
# / is the division operator, used to perform division between two numbers.
# For example: 10 / 3 results in 3.333... (in Python 3, it gives a floating-point result).
# % is the modulo operator, used to get the remainder of a division operation.
# For example: 10 % 3 gives 1 because 10 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1.

#c
# / is the division operator (as explained above).
# // is the floor division operator, used to perform division where the result isrounded down to the nearest whole number.
# For example: 10 // 3 results in 3 as it gives the integer part of the division.

#d
# * is the multiplication operator, used to perform multiplication between two numbers.
# For example: 5 * 3 results in 15.
# ** is the exponentiation operator, used to raise a number to the power of another number.
# For example: 2 ** 3 results in 8 because 2 raised to the power of 3 equals 8.

# Random variables are variables in statistics and probability theory that represent the outcomes of random 
# phenomena. They can take on various values depending on the outcome of a random experiment.

# Here are two examples of random variables:

# 1.Coin Toss: Consider a random experiment of tossing a fair coin. The outcome of this experiment can be either
# "heads" or "tails."We can define a random variable X to represent the number of heads obtained in a single toss. 
# X can take values from the set {0,1},where 0 represents the outcome "tails" and 1 represents the outcome "heads."

# Rolling a Die: Suppose we roll a fair six-sided die. The possible outcomes are the numbers 1 through 6. 
# We can define a random variable Y to represent the outcome of the roll. Y can take values from the set 
# {1,2,3,4,5,6}, where each value represents the number rolled on the die.

# In both examples, the random variable represents the result of a random experiment, 
# and its value depends on the outcome of that experiment.

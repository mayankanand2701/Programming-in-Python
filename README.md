# Python Programming Repository

Welcome to my Python programming repository! Python is a powerful and widely used programming language known for its efficiency and versatility. In this repository, you will find a collection of fundamental Python programming questions, as well as assignments from the DS Lab (Python for Data Science).

## Contents

This repository is organized into two main folders:

### 1. Basic Python

This folder contains fundamental Python programming questions that I solved while learning Python. You'll find various topics covered here, including basic syntax, data structures, control flow, functions, and more. These exercises are aimed at solidifying your understanding of Python fundamentals.

### 2. Python for Data Science

In this folder, I'll be sharing my learnings and assignments related to Python for Data Science. This includes topics such as data manipulation, visualization, machine learning, and other relevant aspects of data science using Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn. 

## Updates

I will be updating this repository regularly, adding new solutions, assignments, and learnings. Feel free to explore the content, provide feedback, or ask questions if you have any.

Thank you for visiting my repository! Happy coding! ðŸ˜„
